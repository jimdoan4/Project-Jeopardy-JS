# Project - Code Jeopardy Game

* Jeopardy game focused on guessing the correct answer to coding questions ranging from HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and MongoDB.

## Description

* Use HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, and Bootstrap as a front-end framework.
* Have high quality code.
* Be deployed on Netlify.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to create an easy game where a player has to pick a category and a point value. The higher the point value, the harder the question becomes. Once a category box is clicked on, a modal will appear with questions and four possible answers. If the player chooses the correct answer, his or her point will increase or decrease, if the player answers incorrectly, according to the point value.
